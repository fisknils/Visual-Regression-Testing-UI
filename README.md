# Visual Regression Testing GUI
This project aims to provide the web developoment community with a Visual Regression Testing kit that is quick to set up and easy to customize when you are working with a specific module or page.

It's a little buggy still, so beyond that scope, I wouldn't really trust the results.

At the moment there is no compiled release, but if you'd like to try the development snapshot, we're fine with that.

## Setting up and running dev snapshot
```
git clone https://github.com/fisknils/Visual-Regression-Testing-UI.git
cd Visual-Regression-Testing-UI
npm i
npm dev
```
